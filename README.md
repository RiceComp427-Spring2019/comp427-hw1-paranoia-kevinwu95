## Problem 1
- Scenario: TSA
- Assumptions:
  In this scenario, we are making the assumption that the attackers’ goals (intents) can be 
  - causing damage to property integrity and personal safety in the airport on during flight, disrupting regular airport
    service, gaining airport and passengers’ confidential information. 
  - Also, we also assume that there will be a large number of passengers going through security screening every day. 
  - Since the scenario is for security screening process, we have to assume that the adversary cannot bring in anything 
    from entrances other than the checkpoints to initialize the attack.
  - Also, we can only have countermeasures at the checkpoints. The other airport subsystems' security measures are out 
    of our hand. 
- Assets:
  The assets we are considering can be the following. 
  - We need to consider the safety of the people within the airport and during the flight because the adversaries can 
    try to harm the people involved due to their political statement or anti-social personalities. 
  - The integrity and availability of services provided by the airport are also our assets because it is the primary 
    function the airport. 
  - Also, we need to consider the integrity of the physical properties as well because the adversaries can also try to 
    damage the physical properties of the airport and airlines. 
  - The confidential information of the airport personnel and passengers is also our assets because the adversary can 
    also aim to acquire these for further exploits. 
- Threats:
  The threats we need to consider can be the following. 
  - The adversaries can launch attacks like vandalism targeting physical properties of the airports and airlines. 
  - They can also launch attacks like poisoning to target personal safety in the airport and planes. 
  - Also, the adversaries can launch forms of denial-of-service attacks like having bomb-like objects placed in multiple
    places to cause disturbances and panics such that regular airport services can be delayed or denied. 
  - Furthermore, the adversaries can also aim to acquire confidential information about the airport, the airlines, 
    the personnel, and the passengers by hacking airport system for further exploits. 
  - Also, the adversaries can also try to create a backdoor, either physical like an actual door or conceptual like a 
    bribed employee, inside the airport so that further attacks can be carried through using it. 
  - In addition, the adversaries can also try to bypass our security screening by providing forged identification or 
    having compromised security personnel.  
  - The worst of all, is to have adversaries capable of carrying out ad-hoc attacks on the spot using materials and 
    instruments accessible within the airport and airplane. 
  These are all threats that the checkpoint screening must consider.
- Countermeasures:
  In terms of countermeasures, screening is our primary method. There are several form of screening processes trying to 
  address these threats. 
  - First of all, we can use identification documents, like photo IDs, to identify known adversaries. This can partially
    prevent threats, especially those that does not require bringing instruments through the checkpoints. For example, 
    this should increase the chance to spot people who intent to bribe airport personnel to create a backdoor, to hack 
    into the airport system to acquire confidential information, or to carry through any kind of ad-hoc attacks on the 
    spots using materials within the airport or airplanes. Since we only care about the checkpoint, the security of other
    subsystem in the airport is not our business, like having better WiFi security and airport electronic system security.
  - The second screening process is to screen personal belongings that they try to bring into the airport. This can 
    prevent attacks that requires special materials or instruments like weapons, explosives, and hazardous materials. 
    This can be done using the current x-ray machine to scan any personal belongings and even one’s entire body in case 
    the adversaries are trying to hide them. 
  - Speaking of backdoor, the adversaries can also try to bride, or simply plant the security personnel at the 
    checkpoints; therefore, we also need to do background check to the security personnel and train them not to take bribe.
