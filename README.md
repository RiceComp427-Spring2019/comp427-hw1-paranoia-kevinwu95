## Problem 1
- Scenario: TSA
- Assumptions:
  In this scenario, we are making the assumption that the attackers’ goals (intents) can be 
  - causing damage to property integrity and personal safety in the airport on during flight, disrupting regular airport
    service, gaining airport and passengers’ confidential information. 
  - Also, we also assume that there will be a large number of passengers going through security screening every day. 
  - Since the scenario is for security screening process, we have to assume that the adversary cannot bring in anything 
    from entrances other than the checkpoints.
